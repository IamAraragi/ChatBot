## Introduction
Built a simple chatbot using Natural Language Processing and Deep Neural Networks. the model is a simple Seq2Seq model and the dataset used is Cornell Movie Dialog Corpus. We have implemented three different versions of Recurrent Neural Network: basic LSTM model, basic GRU model and GRU with Attention Mechanism and compared their performance.
